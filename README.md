## ðŸ”¹ Core Software Concepts

- **Simplicity**: Keep it easy and clean. No mess.  
- **Flexibility**: Can change easily if needed.  
- **Redundancy**: Backup plans. Just in case.  
- **Modularity**: Break your code into neat, small parts.  
- **Reusability**: Write once, use many times.  
- **Scalability**: Grows easily without crashing.  
- **Maintainability**: Easy to fix or update.  
- **Portability**: Runs on any system (Windows, Linux, Mac).  
- **Reliability**: Works properly. All the time.  
- **Availability**: Always ready to use.  
- **Efficiency**: Uses less power and memory.  
- **Performance**: Fast and smooth.  
- **Security**: Safe from hackers and attacks.  
- **Integrity**: Data is correct and untouched.  
- **Confidentiality**: Data stays private.  
- **Abstraction**: Show only whatâ€™s important.  
- **Encapsulation**: Wrap code + data together. Keep it safe.  
- **Polymorphism**: One thing, many forms.  
- **Inheritance**: Child code gets stuff from parent code.  
- **Overloading**: Same name, different input.  
- **Overriding**: Child changes how parent behaves.

## ðŸ”¹ System & Network Terms

- **Latency**: Delay. Like buffering in a slow video.  
- **Bandwidth**: Data speed limit.  
- **Throughput**: How much data actually gets through.  
- **Load Balancing**: Share work across servers.  
- **Fault Tolerance**: Still works even if parts break.  
- **Concurrency**: Tasks running at the same time.  
- **Parallelism**: Doing many things at once.  
- **Deadlock**: Two programs waiting for each other forever.  
- **Race Condition**: Programs fighting over who goes first.  
- **Thread**: A lightweight task.  
- **Process**: A running program.

## ðŸ”¹ Database Terms

- **Normalization**: Organize data to avoid copies.  
- **Denormalization**: Add some copies for faster speed.  
- **Index**: Like a table of contents for quick search.  
- **Transaction**: All steps succeed or none do.  
- **Atomicity**: All-or-nothing.  
- **Consistency**: Data stays correct.  
- **Isolation**: One operation doesnâ€™t mess up another.  
- **Durability**: Data survives even after a crash.  
- **Primary Key**: Unique ID for each row.  
- **Foreign Key**: Link between tables.  
- **Schema**: The blueprint of your database.  
- **Query**: Ask for data.

## ðŸ”¹ Programming Principles & Practices

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Donâ€™t repeat yourself.  
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Keep it simple.  
- **YAGNI (You Ainâ€™t Gonna Need It)**: Donâ€™t build what you donâ€™t need.  
- **SOLID**: 5 rules for better object-oriented code.  
- **Tight Coupling**: Too much dependency â€” risky.  
- **Loose Coupling**: Less dependency â€” flexible.  
- **Cohesion**: A module should do one thing well.  
- **Code Smell**: Somethingâ€™s off with the code â€” fix it.  
- **Refactoring**: Clean up code without changing what it does.  
- **Debugging**: Fixing errors.  
- **Unit Testing**: Test small pieces of your app.  
- **Mocking**: Fake parts to test real parts.
